NOTES FOR TA: 

When trying to run my program please enter the number of verticies N you plan to enter, and then copy and paste the array that you will use in the variable that says int[][] theArray = ...;

I made an adjacency array in another file called Graph.java to help me visualize it, but I realized that I couldn't turn in more than 1 file. Since I couldn't figure out how to move the adjacency matrix code portion into the Judge.java file I just commented out the code that makes the matrix since the code works without that.
